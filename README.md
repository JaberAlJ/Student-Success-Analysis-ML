## 📘 Overview

This repository tackles the critical issue of student retention and academic success in higher education using **machine learning**. By analyzing a rich dataset of **demographics**, **academic performance**, and **socioeconomic factors**, we aim to **predict student outcomes** and support early intervention strategies that boost graduation rates.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal is to **predict a student's academic outcome** and enable timely interventions. The prediction includes three possible classes:

- 🔴 **Dropout**
- 🟡 **Remain Enrolled**
- 🟢 **Successfully Graduate**

This represents a **multi-class classification problem** with imbalanced data — a realistic and challenging scenario for educational analytics.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

- 👥 **Instances:** 4,424 students  
- 🧬 **Features:** 36 (demographic, academic, economic)  
- 🎯 **Target Variable:** `Target` — categorical with values: `Dropout`, `Enrolled`, `Graduate`

### 🔍 Feature Categories

1. 🧑‍🎓 **Demographics & Socioeconomic**  
   Gender, Age, Marital Status, Nationality, Parental Education & Occupation, Scholarship, Tuition Fees, Application Mode

2. 📚 **Academic History**  
   Degree Program, Curricular Units (Enrolled/Approved), Admission Grade, Grades, Previous Qualifications

3. 🌐 **External Factors**  
   GDP, Inflation Rate, Unemployment Rate during enrollment year

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features

### 2. 🧪 Dimensionality Reduction
- Used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify feature space while preserving variance

### 3. 🤖 Model Building
- Trained and compared:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**
- Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**
- Evaluated models using:
  - ✅ Accuracy
  - 📉 Confusion Matrix
  - 🧾 Classification Report

### 4. 🌟 Feature Importance Analysis
- Identified key features most correlated with student outcomes

---

## 📈 Key Findings

1. 🎯 **Academic Performance is the Strongest Predictor**  
   Early grades, especially in the first semester, are highly indicative of future success.

2. 💰 **Financial Stability Matters**  
   Students with scholarships or consistent tuition payment history are more likely to graduate.

3. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Background Factors Have Influence**  
   Parental education, enrollment age, and gender are linked to student outcomes.

4. 🌍 **Macroeconomic Environment Impacts Success**  
   Students enrolling during periods of economic stability show better academic persistence.

## ✅ Recommendations

### 1. 🚨 Early Intervention
- Develop real-time academic monitoring tools  
- Offer tutoring, peer mentorship, and academic coaching

### 2. 💸 Financial Support
- Increase access to scholarships and financial aid  
- Introduce financial literacy workshops

### 3. 🎯 Targeted Programs
- Create special programs for first-generation and high-risk students  
- Promote flexible learning paths and community engagement

### 4. 🧱 Build Economic Resilience
- Offer work-study programs and paid internships  
- Partner with employers for job placements and career support
